Warning: You will need to reset your client secrets and provide a new ini 
config 'oauth2_provider.salt' when upgrading from v0.2.0.
</aside>

Getting Started
---------------

In an existing pyramid project you can take advantage of pyramid_oauth2_provider
by doing the following:

* Add `config.include('pyramid_oauth2_provider')` to your project setup. This
  will configure a `/oauth2/token` route for the token endpoint and an
  authentication policy that will support oauth2. If you want to be able to use 
  both cookie auth and oauth2 at the same time, you should use the
  `pyramid_oauth2_provider.authentication.OauthTktAuthenticationPolicy` instead
  of the default.
* Define a implementation of the `pyramid_oauth2_provider.interfaces.IAuthCheck`
  interface that works against your current user authentication check mechanism.
* In your paster configuration configure which IAuthCheck implementation to use
  by specifying `oauth2_provider.auth_checker`.
* In your production/development configuration, set a 16 random byte, base64 
  encoded salt for scrypt:
        
        oauth2_provider.salt = REPLACEME
        
  How to generate a salt in Python:
  
        from base64 import b64encode
        b64encode(os.urandom(16)).decode('utf-8')

* In your development configuration, you may also want to disable ssl
  enforcement by specifying `oauth2_provider.require_ssl = false`.
* Generate client credentials using the `create_client_credentials` script,
  provided as part of `pyramid_oauth2_provider`.

Request Flow
------------
Let's start by laying out a few ground rules when it comes to oauth2:

1. All requests *must* be made via HTTPS.
2. All data is transferred in headers and the body of messages rather than
   through url parameters.

The token endpoint is provided as a way to obtain and renew `access_tokens`.

#### Example initial token request:

        POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
        Host: server.example.com
        Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

        grant_type=password&username=johndoe&password=A3ddj3w

* The basic auth header is the `client_id:client_secret` base64 encoded.
* Content-Type must be application/x-www-form-urlencoded

#### Example refresh token request:

        POST /token HTTP/1.1
        Host: server.example.com
        Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

        grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKW&user_id=1234

* The basic auth header is the `client_id:client_secret` base64 encoded.
* Content-Type must be application/x-www-form-urlencoded
* The `grant_type` must be "refresh".
* All form elements are required.

#### Example token response:

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {
          "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
          "token_type":"bearer",
          "expires_in":3600,
          "refresh_token":"tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKW",
          "user_id":1234,
        }

* The same response is returned for both auth token and refresh token requests.
* The `token_type` will always be "bearer".
* For purposes of this example the `access_token` and `refresh_token` are
  shorter than normal.
